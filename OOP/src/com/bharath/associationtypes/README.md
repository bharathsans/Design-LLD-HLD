Association vs Aggregation vs Composition in Java
Understanding relationships between classes is fundamental in object-oriented design. These relationships define how objects interact, how tightly they're coupled, and how their lifecycles are managed.

In Java, three common types of relationships are:

Association

Aggregation

Composition

Each has its own characteristics and real-world analogies.

1. Association
Definition: A relationship where all participating objects have their own lifecycle and there is no ownership. One object uses another, but they are not dependent on each other.

Real-World Analogy: A Doctor can treat a Patient. Both can exist independently of each other.

Key Points:

No ownership.

Objects are loosely coupled.

Can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.

Code Snippet (simplified, not using fenced blocks):

Doctor doctor = new Doctor("Dr. Smith", "Cardiology", null);
Patient patient = new Patient("John Doe", List.of(doctor));

The Doctor and Patient are associated.

Either can exist independently.

The relationship is optional and non-owning.

2. Aggregation
Definition: A specialized form of association where one object "has-a" another. However, the part can still exist independently of the whole.

Real-World Analogy: A Hospital has many Doctors. Doctors can work at multiple hospitals or exist independently.

Key Points:

Has-a relationship.

Whole and part have independent lifecycles.

Represented with a hollow diamond (◇) in UML.

Code Snippet:

List<Doctor> doctors = List.of(new Doctor("Dr. Alice", "Neurology", null));
Hospital hospital = new Hospital("City Hospital", doctors);

The Hospital aggregates Doctors.

The Doctor objects are passed into the Hospital constructor.

The Doctors can still exist if the Hospital is destroyed.

3. Composition
Definition: A strong form of aggregation where the part cannot exist without the whole. The whole is responsible for the creation and destruction of the part.

Real-World Analogy: A Library contains Books. If the Library is destroyed, its Books also cease to exist.

Key Points:

Strong ownership.

The part cannot exist independently of the whole.

Represented with a filled diamond (◆) in UML.

Code Snippet:

Library library = new Library();
System.out.println(library.getBooks().get(0).getTitle());

The Library creates and manages Book objects internally.

Book instances are tied to the lifecycle of the Library.

Interview Insights
These relationships reflect how real-world entities interact.

Association is the most basic; it simply models communication.

Aggregation is ideal when the container should not tightly manage the lifecycle of the parts.

Composition is preferred when parts should not outlive their parent.

Favor Composition over Inheritance — it's a core principle of effective object-oriented design.

Quick Definitions Recap
Association: Loosely coupled relationship with no ownership.

Aggregation: Has-a relationship where the part can outlive the whole.

Composition: Has-a relationship where the part’s lifecycle is managed by the whole.
