# Encapsulation in Java

Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP principles, alongside Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It refers to **bundling the data (variables)** and the **methods (functions)** that operate on the data into a single unit (class), while **restricting direct access** to some of the object's components.

## ‚úÖ What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation ensures that the internal representation of an object is **hidden from the outside**, and access is only provided through **public methods** (getters/setters or business logic methods). 

In Java, encapsulation is typically achieved using:
- `private` access modifier for fields
- `public` getters/setters or business methods for interaction

## üè¶ Real-World Use Case: Bank Account

A `BankAccount` class contains sensitive data like balance. We should prevent external code from modifying it directly to ensure data integrity.

### Key Aspects:
- Balance is marked `private` ‚Äî cannot be accessed directly.
- Public methods `deposit()` and `withdraw()` control access to `balance` with validation logic.
- Read-only access to `balance` through `getBalance()`.

This helps in:
- Preventing unauthorized access/modification.
- Ensuring validation is enforced on all operations.
- Making the class easier to maintain and debug.

## üîê Code Breakdown

### `BankAccount.java`
```java
private double balance;
balance is encapsulated ‚Äî hidden from the outside world.

java
Copy
Edit
public void deposit(double amount) { ... }
public void withdraw(double amount) { ... }
Controlled access to modify balance ‚Äî includes validation.

java
Copy
Edit
public double getBalance() { return balance; }
Provides read-only access to the encapsulated field.

üöÄ Why is Encapsulation Important?
Benefit	Explanation
Security	Data is hidden and access controlled through business logic
Flexibility & Maintainability	Internal implementation can change without affecting external code
Code Reusability	Well-encapsulated classes are more modular and reusable
Improved Debugging	Easier to trace where and how data changes
üß† Interview Tips
Encapsulation protects internal state ‚Äî this is data hiding.

Always use access modifiers (private, protected, etc.) effectively.

Encapsulation ‚â† Getters and Setters only. Business logic methods (like withdraw()) can enforce better encapsulation.

You can encapsulate behavior too ‚Äî think beyond fields.

üìù Conclusion
Encapsulation is all about protecting your object‚Äôs internal state and exposing only what‚Äôs necessary. This improves security, readability, and future-proofing.

In this example, even if business logic changes (e.g., new rules for withdrawal), we don‚Äôt need to change the external usage of the class ‚Äî just update the method implementation inside the class.
